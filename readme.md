# Javascript promises deepdive

## What we will cover

* What is a promise?
* Why is it important?
* Several examples of how to use them.

## Notes

Promises are a way for you to structure async code in a clean
way and they help a lot when you want to keep your async logic
from getting out of hand.

A promise is simply an object that will let you tell async code
what to do when it is done with the operation.

They are important because they allow us to avoid callback hell
among other things.
